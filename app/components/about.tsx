              I&apos;m currently an Engineer at Upstatement building things for
              the web with some awesome people. I recently graduated from
              Northeastern University after completing three awesome six-month
              co-ops at MullenLowe U.S., Starry, and Apple Music.

              As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between
              engineering and design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my
              keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to
              always build applications that are scalable and efficient under
              the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

              When I&apos;m not in front of a computer screen, I&apos;m probably
              snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board, or crossing off
              another item on my bucket list.
